# option-pricing
Python-based option pricing and volatility analysis using real market data

## Overview
This project demonstrates the pricing of European call options using **Black-Scholes** and **Monte Carlo simulations** with real market data. It also computes **implied volatilities** to visualise a **volatility smile**.

The project showcases quantitative finance skills, programming in Python, and handling of financial datasets.
